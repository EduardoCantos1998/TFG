# Sensitivity analysis tool
Sensitivity analysis (SA) is a technique that has allowed researchers from many different fields study complex mathematical models. These studies have allowed researchers
to determine the importance of the parameters of their models. This has helped bring
new light into the importance of the parameters relative to one another, to the whole
model, or as single entities. In other words, it helps the user learn which parameters
are the ones they should focus on. This process can help save time and resources.
SA can be applied on mathematical models, whose role is to find the most appropriate
explanation of complex biological issues. In this project the goal was to analyze the
bio-reactor model, model which allows the researcher to explore the allocation of the
cellular resources, and also of the Michaelis Menten (MM) equation. It was also part of
the project to develop an automated Matlab App, which could allow the host group to
further their research and facilitate their work around analysis of their future research.
Finally what we found was that SA allows us to learn in a more explicit manner, the
way that the model should be focused on. It is also logical to conclude that doing a SA
is better suited for complex models, which have more nuances to consider for, rather
than for simple models, which may have a clear interpretation prior to the sensitivity
analysis.
